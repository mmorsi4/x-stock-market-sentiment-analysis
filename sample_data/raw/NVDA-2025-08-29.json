Explosive AI Infrastructure Demand NVIDIA\u2019s latest earnings call underscored an unprecedented surge in AI infrastructure spending. CEO Jensen Huang expects $3\u20134 trillion in AI infrastructure investment by 2030, calling this projection \u201cfairly sensible for the next five years\u201d. In fact, capital expenditures by the top four cloud providers have doubled to ~$600 billion annually in just two years, and Huang noted we are still \u201cat the beginning of this buildout\u201d across industries. This indicates a long runway of growth for companies that can supply data center capacity. Importantly, the demand isn\u2019t confined to Big Tech \u2013 NVIDIA\u2019s CFO highlighted broad drivers including cloud and enterprise AI adoption, government \u201csovereign AI\u201d projects, and even physical AI/robotics, all requiring huge compute resources. In short, a worldwide AI data center build-out is underway, which forms a massive tailwind for infrastructure providers like $IREN.",

    "content": "$NVDA NETWORK REVENUE AT 98% Nvidia\u2019s networking revenue hit $7.3B this quarter, up 98% YoY and 46% QoQ. Growth was fueled by NVLink compute fabric for GB200/GB300 systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand, and rising Ethernet adoption for AI workloads. Why it matters? This surge confirms the massive infrastructure build-out behind AI, and it directly lifts suppliers and ecosystem players. $ALAB benefits from PCIe connectivity and smart fabric controllers, $MRVL from custom ASIC and optical interconnects, and $AVGO from switching, optics, and high-speed networking chips.",

Q1 networking revenue was 4.9B (up 63.9% QoQ and 56.3% YoY). Q2 was 7.2B (up 46.3% QoQ and 97.7% YoY). That's 28.8B ARR (at least). But could be higher given the increasing demand in scale up, scale out, and scale across. We can also expect upside for $AVGO's networking business.",

Upon further analysis: We see GB200NVL72 (Blackwell) generating 8.3 TFLOPS of performance per watt. But AMD's MI355X: In the real world though, it comes down to hardware + software. So here's how both the GPUs perform head-to-head in the DeepSeek R1 inference performance: Clearly, $AMD wins out on concurrency scaling - meaning, that it delivers more predictable, lower latency as the requests scale. As for NVIDIA, it struggles a lot with higher latency unless heavily optimized with TensorRT, and even then it\u2019s not as efficient as MI300. This is still just one metric. I chose it for comparison since it's closer to real-life use cases. There's other metrics where Nvidia outdoes AMD, and they have their own merits. The point at the end of the day is that AMD is catching up significantly with every generation in both hardware and software.",
