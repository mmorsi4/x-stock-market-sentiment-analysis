Explosive AI Infrastructure Demand NVIDIA’s latest earnings call underscored an unprecedented surge in AI infrastructure spending. CEO Jensen Huang expects $3–4 trillion in AI infrastructure investment by 2030, calling this projection “fairly sensible for the next five years”. In fact, capital expenditures by the top four cloud providers have doubled to ~$600 billion annually in just two years, and Huang noted we are still “at the beginning of this buildout” across industries. This indicates a long runway of growth for companies that can supply data center capacity. Importantly, the demand isn’t confined to Big Tech – NVIDIA’s CFO highlighted broad drivers including cloud and enterprise AI adoption, government “sovereign AI” projects, and even physical AI/robotics, all requiring huge compute resources. In short, a worldwide AI data center build-out is underway, which forms a massive tailwind for infrastructure providers like $IREN.","created_at":"2025-08-28 10:02:09+00:00","likes":297,"retweets":37,"replies":11,"hashtags":[],"url":"https://x.com/FransBakker9812/status/1961006380476748212","sentiment":"positive","sentiment_score":0.791838526725769},{"id":1961048258215653467,"ticker":"$NVDA","username":"Investingcom","display_name":"Investing.com","content":"*NVIDIA IN TALKS WITH US TO SELL BLACKWELL AI CHIP TO CHINA: FOX *NVIDIA WILLING TO GIVE US CUT OF BLACKWELL CHINA SALES: FOX $NVDA https://t.co/f9qtzbM4hD","created_at":"2025-08-28 12:48:33+00:00","likes":268,"retweets":45,"replies":17,"hashtags":[],"url":"https://x.com/Investingcom/status/1961048258215653467","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_score":0.7208739519119263},{"id":1961132171046867341,"ticker":"$NVDA","username":"unusual_whales","display_name":"unusual_whales","content":"Nvidia, $NVDA, is down 0.8% after earnings: https://t.co/qpFkoB9tCV","created_at":"2025-08-28 18:22:00+00:00","likes":243,"retweets":21,"replies":75,"hashtags":[],"url":"https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1961132171046867341","sentiment":"negative","sentiment_score":0.5033131837844849},{"id":1961153528942018906,"ticker":"$NVDA","username":"DividendDude_X","display_name":"Dividend Dude","content":"NVIDIA $NVDA CEO JENSEN HUANG JUST SAID WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET APPROVED TO SELL IN CHINA IS “FINE WITH US.” BULLISH FOR AI! https://t.co/zFcjmEtcb6","created_at":"2025-08-28 19:46:52+00:00","likes":215,"retweets":20,"replies":18,"hashtags":[],"url":"https://x.com/DividendDude_X/status/1961153528942018906","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_score":0.5930763483047485},{"id":1960712169504252271,"ticker":"$NVDA","username":"MasterPandaWu","display_name":"Master WU","content":"In $NVDA We Trust: (1) did some long-term wave count for $NVDA; believe this GIANT is only in its 30s and has a long life in front of him.

Don't MARRY your stocks, RENT them!!! $TSLA and $NVDA are the two biggest stocks I see people marrying. Marrying stocks is dangerous. If it works out it works out but TOO many people get blinded by the emotional attachment. They SIMPLY can't walk away Eventually like many marriages, someone cheats. The SEX got boring, or maybe you just grew apart. If you STAY fixated on it, you won't know when to cut your losses and you'll ride yourself back to ground zero. You didn't make a VOW at the altar to go the grave with it. So don't be so attached. Stocks move up and down, they move in cycles!

Upon further analysis: We see GB200NVL72 (Blackwell) generating 8.3 TFLOPS of performance per watt. But AMD's MI355X: In the real world though, it comes down to hardware + software. So here's how both the GPUs perform head-to-head in the DeepSeek R1 inference performance: Clearly, $AMD wins out on concurrency scaling - meaning, that it delivers more predictable, lower latency as the requests scale. As for NVIDIA, it struggles a lot with higher latency unless heavily optimized with TensorRT, and even then it’s not as efficient as MI300. This is still just one metric. I chose it for comparison since it's closer to real-life use cases. There's other metrics where Nvidia outdoes AMD, and they have their own merits. The point at the end of the day is that AMD is catching up significantly with every generation in both hardware and software.","created_at":"2025-08-28 19:02:56+00:00","likes":10,"retweets":2,"replies":0,"hashtags":[],"url":"https://x.com/rebound_capital/status/1961142475017654359","sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_score":0.5383059978485107},{"id":1961352731001507854,"ticker":"$NVDA","username":"o4xgbnzdld80748","display_name":"o4xgbnzdldabdj6","content":"He's a finance professor @Strong845Strong.I made $100,000 in two weeks by buying the stocks he recommended.
